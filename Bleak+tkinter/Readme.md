## Installation Steps

### Install Python 3.x

If not already installed, download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Install Bleak

Bleak is an asynchronous Bluetooth API that supports asyncio. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install bleak
```

### Verify Tkinter

Ensure Tkinter is installed by running:

```bash
python -m tkinter

A small window should pop up. If it does, Tkinter is installed.
